# [Microservices Identification Through Interface Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67262-5_2)

## Abstract

The microservices architectural style is gaining more and more momentum for the
development of applications as suites of small, autonomous, and conversational
services, which are then easy to understand, deploy and scale. One of todayâ€™s
problems is finding the adequate granularity and cohesiveness of microservices,
both when starting a new project and when thinking of transforming, evolving and
scaling existing applications. To cope with these problems, the paper proposes a
solution based on the semantic similarity of foreseen/available functionality
described through OpenAPI specifications. By leveraging a reference vocabulary,
our approach identifies potential candidate microservices, as fine-grained
groups of cohesive operations (and associated resources). We compared our
approach against a state-of-the-art tool, sampled microservices-based
applications and decomposed a large dataset of Web APIs. Results show that our
approach is able to find suitable decompositions in some 80% of the cases, while
providing early insights about the right granularity and cohesiveness of
obtained microservices.
