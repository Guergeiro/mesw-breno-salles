# [Towards Decomposing Monolithic Applications into Microservices](https://doi.org/10.1109/AICT50176.2020.9368571)

## Abstract

Continuously changing the existing software systems results in large and
monolith software solutions making them difficult to maintain. As maintenance
and development of monolithic software systems is a difficult task, there is a
need for decomposing these monolithic systems into smaller subsystems,
components and services, i.e., microservices. Service-oriented architectures
yield more maintenance and less complexity in developing large-scale software
applications. Thus, this paper focuses on decomposing monolithic software
systems into microservices in order to maintain them with less development
effort. Moreover, it addresses to the problem of architectural refactoring and
improvement of software systems during architectural migration.
