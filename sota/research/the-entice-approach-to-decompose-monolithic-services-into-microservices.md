# [The ENTICE approach to decompose monolithic services into microservices](https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568389)

## Abstract

Cloud computing has enabled elastic and on-demand service provisioning to
achieve more efficient resource utilisation and quicker responses to varying
application loads. Virtual machines, the building blocks of clouds, can be
created using provider specific templates stored in proprietary repositories,
which may lead to provider lock-in and decreased portability. Despite these
enabling technologies, large scale service oriented applications are still
mostly inelastic. Such applications often use monolithic services that limit the
elasticity (e.g., by obstructing the replicability of parts of a monolithic
service). Decomposing these services (leading to smaller, more targeted and more
modular services) would open towards elasticity, but the decomposition process
is mostly manual. This paper introduces a methodology for decomposing monolithic
services to several so called microservices. The proposed methodology applies
several outcomes of the ENTICE project (namely its image synthesis and
optimisation tools). Finally, the paper provides insights on how these outcomes
help revitalise past monolithic services, and what techniques are applied to aid
future microservice developers.
