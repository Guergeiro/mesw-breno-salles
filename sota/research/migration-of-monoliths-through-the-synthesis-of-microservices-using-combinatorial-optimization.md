# [Migration of Monoliths through the Synthesis of Microservices using Combinatorial Optimization](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW53611.2021.00056)

## Abstract

Microservices are an emerging architectural style that is gaining a growing
interest from companies and research. They are small, distributed, autonomous
and loosely coupled services that are deployed independently and work together
by communicating through lightweight protocols. Microservices are easy to
update, scale, deploy, and reduce the time-to-market thanks to continuous
delivery and DevOps. Several existing systems, in contrast, are difficult to
maintain, evolve, and scale. For these reasons, microservices are the ideal
candidates for the refactoring and modernization of long-lived monolithic
systems. However, the migration process is a complex, time-consuming and
error-prone task that needs the support of appropriate tools to assist software
designers and programmers from the extraction of a proper architecture to the
implementation of the novel microservices. This paper proposes a possible
solution for the automated decomposition of a monolithic system into
microservices, which exploits combinatorial optimization techniques to manage
the decomposition. Our proposal covers the whole decomposition process, from the
microservice architecture definition to the generation of the code of the
microservices and their APIs, in order to assist developers and ensure by
construction the correct behavior of the refactored system.
