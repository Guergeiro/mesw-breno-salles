The study aimed to demonstrate that using the application for performing
monolith decomposition tasks is better than not using it. Throughout the study,
various threats to validity were identified and categorised into two main
categories according to Wohlin et al \cite{wohlin2012experimentation}: internal
validity, conclusion validity, construct validity, and external validity.
