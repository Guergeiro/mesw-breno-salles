In order to filter the publications, the title and the abstract will be
analysed and should mention at least one of:

\begin{enumerate}[{IC}1.]
  \item A tool that automates the process of migration of monoliths to
    microservices.
  \item Identification of microservices from monolith systems.
  \item Analysis of tools or approaches for migrating from monoliths to
    microservices.
\end{enumerate}

In cases of ambiguous abstracts, further inspection of the publication may be
done. When this happens, and if relevant publications apply, conclusions should
also be taken into account.

As for more pratical approach for exclusion of publications, the criteria will
be:

\begin{enumerate}[{EC}1.]
  \item Publications that are not written in English or Portuguese.
  \item Publication is not accessible.
\end{enumerate}
