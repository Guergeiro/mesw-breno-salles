The majority of works utilised Java as their primary programming language for
input \citeSLR{al2021microservice, bucchiarone2020model, assunccao2022analysis,
  zhao2021applying, nitin2022cargo, kalia2021mono2micro, kalia2020mono2micro,
agarwal2021monolith, pigazzini2019tool, krishna2021transforming}. This may be
attributed to the language's strict syntax rules, which facilitate the
examination of source code during the inspection process. Additionally, some of
them utilised the Spring Boot framework in conjunction with Java
\citeSLR{wei2020feature, nunes2019monolith, brito2021identification,
santos2021microservice, freitas2021refactoring, pigazzini2019tool}, which
further enforces structure through the utilisation of decorators. In contrast,
those who employed programming languages other than Java, such as Python,
utilised corresponding frameworks like Django, to compensate for the language's
more lenient syntax constraints \citeSLR{matias2020determining,
asseldonk2021monolith}.
