This section presents the prototype solution to the design mentioned in
\Cref{sec:tool_design}. We implemented the system's backend using Node.js, an
open-source JavaScript runtime environment. Despite JavaScript's inherent
limitations, such as its dynamic nature, employing Node.js allowed us to
rapidly prototype a solution, a crucial requirement in this work. To mitigate
the drawbacks associated with JavaScript, TypeScript was chosen as the primary
programming language, benefiting from its static typing and enhanced tooling
capabilities. As for the frontend, we used UI frameworks like React and SolidJS
alongside TypeScript.
