# [MicroValid: a validation framework for automatically decomposed microservices](https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2019.00023)

## Abstract

In a dynamic world of software development, the architectural styles are
continuously evolving, adapting to new technologies and trends. Microservice
architecture (MSA) is gaining adoption among industry practitioners due to its
advantages compared to the monolithic architecture. Although MSA builds on the
core concepts of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), it pushes for a finer
granularity, with stricter boundaries. Due to cost rationale, numerous companies
choose to migrate from the monolithic style instead of developing from scratch.
Recently, semi-automatic decomposition tools assist the migration process, yet a
crucial part is still missing: validation. The current study focuses on
providing a validation framework for microservices decomposed from monolithic
applications and complete the puzzle of architectural migrations. From previous
work we select quality attributes of microservices that may be assessed using
static analysis. We then provide an implementation specification of the
validation framework. We use five applications to evaluate our approach, and the
results show that our solution is scalable while providing insightful
measurements of the assessed quality attributes of microservices.
