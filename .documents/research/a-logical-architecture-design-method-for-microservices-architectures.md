# [A logical architecture design method for microservices architectures](https://doi.org/10.1145/3344948.3344991)

## Abstract

The use of microservices architectures has been widely adopted in software
development, especially for cloud-based solutions. Developing such solutions
faces several challenges beyond typical architecture and service design
concerns, including service exposition (API), inter-service communication, and
infrastructure deployment, among others. Although model-driven approaches allow
abstracting microservices behavior from the business domain, there is a lack of
proper methods for addressing the referred challenges. In this paper, the
elicitation of microservices, their identification uses using functionally
decomposed UML use cases as input within a logical architecture derivation
method, namely an adapted version of the Four Step Rule Set (4SRS), using SoaML
diagrams, that responds to microservices specific characteristics. We
demonstrate the approach using a scenario within a live industrial project.
