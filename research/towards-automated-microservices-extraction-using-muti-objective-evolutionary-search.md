# [Towards Automated Microservices Extraction Using Muti-objective Evolutionary Search](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-33702-5_5)

## Abstract

We introduce in this paper a novel approach, named MSExtractor, that formulate
the microservices identification problem as a multi-objective combinatorial
optimization problem to decompose a legacy application into a set of cohesive,
loosely-coupled and coarse-grained services. We employ the non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to drive a search process towards optimal
microservices identification while considering structural dependencies in the
source code. We conduct an empirical evaluation on a benchmark of two
open-source legacy software systems to assess the efficiency of our approach.
Results show that MSExtractor is able to find relevant microservice candidates
and outperforms recent three state-of-the-art approaches.
