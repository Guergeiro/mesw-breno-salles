# [Migrating Legacy Software to Microservices Architecture](https://doi.org/10.1109/eStream.2019.8732170)

## Abstract

As a legacy monolithic software become too large to deal with, many enterprises
are drawn to breaking them down into the microservices architectural style.
Migrating a monolithic architecture to an ecosystem of microservices is an epic
journey. Each legacy monolithic application is unique and migration to
microservices creates different challenges. This article elaborates on
challenges and technics of legacy software migration from monolithic
architecture to microservice architecture. Different migration methods and
techniques are reviewed, and their benefits and drawbacks are analyzed.
Microservices is a relatively new architectural style and legacy monoliths are
very different in many aspects. Existing migration techniques and methods do not
cover every use case.
