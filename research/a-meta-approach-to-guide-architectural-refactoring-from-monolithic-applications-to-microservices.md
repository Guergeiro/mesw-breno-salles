# [A meta-approach to guide architectural refactoring from monolithic applications to microservices](http://doi.org/10.18419/opus-11501)

## Abstract

The concept of microservices in the software development industry is getting
growing attention nowadays. This architectural style is widely discussed both in
industry and academia. Refactoring a monolithic application into a microservice
application is common practice. Nevertheless, software architects and developers
often find it di cult because they lack a structured overview of various
migration approaches. Even though literature views about microservice migration
were conducted, they were either obsolete or did not follow a systematic
approach to ensure correctness and reproducibility of results. The goal of this
study is to provide a classification framework as well as a web-based tool that
can guide software architects and developers to comprehend up-to-date migration
approaches and select a suitable one according to their requirements. In order
to achieve this, a systematic literature review was conducted, resulting in
thirty-one contributions from 2017 to 2020. Next, a web-based tool was developed
based on the knowledge repository created after review. An evaluation of the
developed tool by experts and students in the field revealed that it was able to
serve the predefined purpose. The proposed framework, as well as the web-based
tool, can provide the users a comprehensive overview of microservice migration
and various practical approaches. Keywords: Microservices, Monolith Migration,
Architectural Refactoring, Microservice Migration Framework

## Tool Notes

The tool provided is not platforma agnostic as it requires Windows to setup,
which I don't have.
