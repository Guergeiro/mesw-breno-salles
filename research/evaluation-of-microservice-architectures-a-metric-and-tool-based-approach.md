# [Evaluation of Microservice Architectures: A Metric and Tool-Based Approach](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92901-9_8)

## Abtract

Microservices are an architectural style that decomposes the functionality of an
application system into several small functional units. The services are
implemented and managed independently from each other. Breaking up monolithic
structures into a microservice architecture increases the number of single
components massively. Thus, effective management of the dependencies between
them is required. This task can be supported with the creation and evaluation of
architectural models. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach for
microservice architectures based on identified architecture principles from
research and practice like a small size of the services, a domain-driven design
or loose coupling. Based on a study showing the challenges in current
microservice architectures, we derived principles and metrics for the evaluation
of the architectural design. The required architecture data is captured with a
reverse engineering approach from traces of communication data. The developed
tool is finally evaluated within a case study.
