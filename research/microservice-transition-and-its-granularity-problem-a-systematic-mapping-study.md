# [Microservice transition and its granularity problem: A systematic mapping study](https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2869)

## Abstract

Microservices have gained wide recognition and acceptance in software industries
as an emerging architectural style for autonomic, scalable, and more reliable
computing. The transition to microservices has been highly motivated by the need
for better alignment of technical design decisions with improving value
potentials of architectures. Despite microservices' popularity, research still
lacks disciplined understanding of transition and consensus on the principles
and activities underlying that transition. In this paper, we report on a
systematic mapping study that consolidates various views, approaches and
activities that commonly assist in the transition to microservices. The study
aims to provide a better understanding of the transition; it also contributes a
working definition of the transition and technical activities underlying it. We
term the transition and technical activities leading to microservice
architectures as microservitization. We then shed light on a fundamental problem
of microservitization: microservice granularity and reasoning about its
adaptation as first-class entities. This study reviews state-of-the-art and
-practice related to reasoning about microservice granularity; it reviews
modeling approaches, aspects considered, guidelines and processes used to reason
about microservice granularity. This study identifies opportunities for future
research and development related to reasoning about microservice granularity.
