# [Migrating to Microservices](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-31646-4_3)

## Abstract

Microservice is an architectural pattern which has risen based on the success of
Amazon, Netflix, and other digital-native companies. Designing such architecture
requires understanding your business goals and creating a balance between
microservices benefits and associated drawbacks. This trade-off is essential in
order to successfully migrate your business applications toward microservices.
In this chapter we aim to drive you through this journey by presenting a roadmap
and methodology which has been used successfully in several projects. We guide
you through the typical microservice migration project by using migration
patterns for managing service decomposition and data isolation and replication.
Those patterns may be used iteratively and in any order, therefore we will
define a reference architecture to sequence the building of your microservice
architecture. Eventually we conclude with a use case from the real world.
