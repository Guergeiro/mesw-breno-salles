# [Towards a Technique for Extracting Microservices from Monolithic Enterprise Systems](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1605.03175)

## Abstract

The idea behind microservices architecture is to develop a single large, complex
application as a suite of small, cohesive, independent services. On the other
way, monolithic systems get larger over the time, deviating from the intended
architecture, and becoming risky and expensive to evolve. This paper describes a
technique to identify and define microservices on monolithic enterprise systems.
As the major contribution, our evaluation shows that our approach was able to
identify relevant candidates to become microservices on a 750 KLOC banking
system.
