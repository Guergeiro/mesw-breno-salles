With multiple papers selected as candidates for final reading, I thought it was
interesting to group them in multiple categories in order to priotize the ones
that are more developed for our problem in hands. The following categories were
chosen:

- Identification method used (data flow, execution log, graph, dependency, etc).
- The status of the work, does it have a tool, does it have an algorithm, does
  it have the method.
- Type of language that it targets: Java, Cpp, C, or is it language agnostic.
- Case studies
