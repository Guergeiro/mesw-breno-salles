# [Identifying Microservices Using Functional Decomposition](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99933-3_4)

## Abstract

The microservices architectural style is rising fast, and many companies use
this style to structure their systems. A big challenge in designing this
architecture is to find an appropriate partition of the system into
microservices. Microservices are usually designed intuitively, based on the
experience of the designers. We describe a systematic approach to identify
microservices in early design phase which is based on the specification of the
systemâ€™s functional requirements and that uses functional decomposition. To
evaluate our approach, we have compared microservices implementations by three
independent teams to the decomposition provided by our approach. The evaluation
results show that our decomposition is comparable to manual design, yet within a
much shorter time frame.
