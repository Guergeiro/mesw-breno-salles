# [Automatic Microservices Identification Across Structural Dependenc](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-96305-7_36)

## Abstract

Microservices oriented architecture has become increasingly popular, especially
with the rise in the use of resource-intensive applications. Indeed, companies
are faced with challenges related to the performance of their services in terms
of technical infrastructure cost and in terms of development, deployment and
system maintenance.However, microservices allow the company to react much more
promptly to new requirements and therefore avoid an endless development process
over several years. Identifying microservices that are cohesive, loosely
coupled, and fine-grained nowadays is a major challenge for most organizations.
To address this challenge, we have proposed in this paper a technique for
identifying microservices which decomposes our system using clustering. To this
end, we have used the business process as the system input and we have only
taken into account the aspect of structural dependency.
