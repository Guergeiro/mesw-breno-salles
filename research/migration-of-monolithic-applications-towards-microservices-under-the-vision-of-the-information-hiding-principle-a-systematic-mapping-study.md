# [Migration of Monolithic Applications Towards Microservices Under the Vision of the Information Hiding Principle: A Systematic Mapping Study](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32022-5_9)

## Abstract

Organizations throughout time accumulate applications, which, given their old
age, are generally designed in monolithic architecture. Given technological
advances, enterprise has the necessity to modernize these applications, being
the migration from a monolithic architecture towards microservice architecture a
good alternative, however according to our research many failed attempts were
found. We performed a Systematic Mapping Study in order to obtain studies to
show how to migrate or modernize monolithic applications towards microservices
based on some principle of Software Engineering. As a result, we found that
there are different types of approaches of studies, such as: (a) solution
proposals, (b) experience reports, (c) validations research and (d) opinion
articles. Between the studies found, there are no studies related to migration
process that is based on a Software Engineering principle, nor the Information
Hiding Principle. This research indicates that there is a lack of a theoretical
foundation with guidelines on how to perform a decomposition of a monolithic
application towards microservices. Given this gap, we propose to migrate a
monolithic application to microservices following the principles of the
Information Hiding Principle.
