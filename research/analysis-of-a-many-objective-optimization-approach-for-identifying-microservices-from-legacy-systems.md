# [Analysis of a many-objective optimization approach for identifying microservices from legacy systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-021-10049-7)

## Abstract

The expensive maintenance of legacy systems leads companies to migrate such
systems to modern architectures. Microservice architectural style has become a
trend to modernize monolithic legacy systems. A microservice architecture
consists of small, autonomous, and highly-independent services communicating by
using lightweight network protocols. To support the designing of microservice
architectures, recent studies have proposed either single or multi-objective
approaches. In order to improve the effectiveness of existing approaches, we
introduced toMicroservices that is a many-objective search-based approach to aid
the identification of boundaries among services. In previous studies, we have
focused on a qualitative evaluation of the applicability and adoption of the
proposed approach from a practical point of view, thus the optimization process
itself has not been investigated in depth. In this paper, we extend our previous
work by performing a more in-depth analysis of our many-objective approach for
microservice identification. We compare our approach against a baseline approach
based on a random search using a set of performance indicators widely used in
the literature of many-objective optimization. Our results are validated through
a real-world case study. The study findings reveal that (i) the criteria
optimized by our approach are interdependent and conflicting; and (ii) all
candidate solutions lead to better performance indicators in comparison to
random search. Overall, the proposed many-objective approach for microservice
identification yields promising results, which shed light on insights for
further improvements.
