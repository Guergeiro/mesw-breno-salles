# [Function-Splitting Heuristics for Discovery of Microservices in Enterprise Systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-03596-9_3)

## Abstract

We present heuristics that help to identify suitable consumer-oriented parts of
enterprise systems which could be re-engineered as microservices. Our approach
assesses the key structural and behavioural properties common to both enterprise
and microservice systems, as needed to guide a microservices discovery process
and coherently assess restructuring recommendations. Building upon existing
business object and system structural definitions, we present heuristics for two
fundamental areas of microservice discovery, namely function splitting based on
object subtypes (i.e., the lowest granularity of software based on structural
properties) and functional splitting based on common execution fragments across
software (i.e., the lowest granularity of software based on behavioural
properties). A prototype analysis tool was developed based on the defined
heuristics and experiments show that it can identify microservice designs which
support multiple microservice characteristics, such as high cohesion, low
coupling, high scalability, high availability, and processing efficiency while
preserving coherent features of enterprise systems. In particular, we illustrate
the usefulness of this new approach by conducting a case study based on customer
management systems: SugarCRM and ChurchCRM.
