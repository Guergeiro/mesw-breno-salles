# [Facilitating the migration to the microservice architecture via model-driven reverse engineering and reinforcement learning](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-022-00977-3)

## Abstract

The microservice architecture has gained remarkable attention in recent years.
Microservices allow developers to implement and deploy independent services, so
they are a naturally effective architecture for continuously deployed systems.
Because of this, several organizations are undertaking the costly process of
manually migrating their traditional software architectures to microservices.
The research in this paper aims at facilitating the migration from monolithic
software architectures to microservices. We propose a framework which enables
software developers/architects to migrate their software systems more
efficiently by helping them remodularize the source code of their systems. The
framework leverages model-driven reverse engineering to obtain a model of the
legacy system and reinforcement learning to propose a mapping of this model
toward a set of microservices.
