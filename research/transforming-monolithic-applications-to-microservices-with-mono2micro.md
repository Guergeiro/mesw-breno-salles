# [Transforming monolithic applications to microservices with Mono2Micro](https://doi.org/10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678851)

## Abstract

Enterprises are increasingly moving their production workloads to the cloud to
take advantage of capabilities, such as streamlined provisioning of
infrastructure and services, elasticity, scalability, reliability, and security.
To leverage such capabilities, monolithic applications typically have to be
decomposed to cloud-native architectures, such as microservices. A microservice
encapsulates a small and well-defined set of business functionalities and
interacts with other services using lightweight mechanisms, often implemented as
RESTful APIs. A recent report shows that only 20% of the enterprise workloads
are in the cloud, and they were predominately written for native cloud
architectures. This leaves 80% of legacy applications onpremises, waiting to be
refactored and modernized for the cloud. In this tutorial, we will discuss the
motivation---supported by illustrative industrial case studies---for modernizing
and migrating legacy applications to cloud. We will then present a detailed
tool-supported approach for transforming a monolithic Java application into
microservices. This will be followed by a handson virtual lab, where
participants will have the opportunity to apply the learned concepts on a
real-world enterprise application. Finally, we will conclude the tutorial with a
discussion of promising directions for future research more broadly in the area
of application modernization.
