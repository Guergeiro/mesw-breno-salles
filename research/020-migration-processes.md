# Migration processes

I started doing this search because while there are some tools that help you
migrate with an approach, they lack giving you multiple approaches. This doesn't
mean that the process of migration is not defined or documented, it may just
mean that is not implemented.

This can help in the future if we choose to implement methodologies found.

The next step was going through the papers references to try to find other
related articles. I only added references to this next file if it's a new
reference, otherwise the reference is already in some of the previous exports.

Following the approach I made before, now I went through the newly find articles
and search for the references of them, to check if I get any new and valid
reference. In doing this, and only noting down new articles found, I make sure I
eventually reduce the list of articles as I predict that the references are
somewhat connected to knowledge I found previously.

The next approach was to for all articles discovered prior, go through all work
that cites said articles and note down new ones that are new.

I reached a point in which multiple publications found via the snowballing
approach were adding little to no value to our general knowledge. I arrived at
the conclusion that the depth first approach should be put on hold and the focus
should be shifted to a breath approach. Therefore, I decided to apply the query
to the remaining publications databases.

On other instances of databases, the query would sometimes produce 20k+ results
and that would be inconsivable to analyze in the given timeframe, therefore I
decided to use the query and only search on the abstract/title of the remaining
libraries. The following query was the one used:

`(microservice* OR "micro-service") AND ( migrat* OR decompos* OR identif* OR refactor* OR evolv* OR extract* OR discover* OR transition*)`

_notes:_ `sciencedirect` doesn't allow for more than 7 `OR` conditions,
therefore I had to split one of them to be in a separate query, but since we are
talking about an `OR` condition, it is fine to have one of them in a separate
query. In the specific case, the `evolv` keyword was moved into a separate
query. Also, `sciencedirect` automatically accepts truncations without using the
`*` char.
