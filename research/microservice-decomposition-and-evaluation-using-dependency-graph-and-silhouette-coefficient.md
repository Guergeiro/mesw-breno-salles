# [Microservice decomposition and evaluation using dependency graph and silhouette coefficient](https://doi.org/10.1145/3483899.3483908)

## Abstract

The benefits provided by microservices architecture in some application
scenarios are a motivating factor for organizations to migrate their monoliths
to this architecture. Extracting microservices from existing monolithic code
bases presents a key challenge in this context, and there is a lack of tools
that automate not only the decomposition processes but also the evaluation of
the resulting architecture. This work presents a new approach for microservice
decomposition that analyzes source code of a monolithic application and, with
the combined use of approaches in the literature, suggests parts to be extracted
in microservices considering the artifacts: classes, methods and/or history of
modifications. The quality of the microservicesâ€™ suggestions are assessed,
quantitatively, through the silhouette coefficient, a quality metric used in
clustering analysis, and the microservice granularity. A tool was developed to
automate the process of microservice decomposition for Java repositories. As a
result, it was observed that the tool generated clusters with satisfactory
results and can be used as an auxiliary instrument by experts during the
migration process from monolithic architecture to microservices.
