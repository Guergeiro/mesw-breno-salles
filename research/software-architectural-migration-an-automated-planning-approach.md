# [Software Architectural Migration: An Automated Planning Approach](https://doi.org/10.1145/3461011)

## Abstract

Software architectural designs are usually changed over time to support emerging
technologies and to adhere to new principles. Architectural migration is an
important activity that helps to transform the architectural styles applied
during a systemâ€™s design with the result of modernising the system. If not
performed correctly, this process could lead to potential system failures. This
article presents an automated approach to refactoring architectural design and
to planning the evolution process. With our solution, the architectural design
can be refactored, ensuring that system functionality is preserved. Furthermore,
the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and
incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world
software applications. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach and
identify factors that impact the performance of architectural verification and
migration planning. An interesting finding is that planning algorithms generate
migration plans that differ in term of their relative efficiency.
