# Possible existing tools

I did this search to be able to see if another tool that solves what we are
trying to accomplish already exists. From my search, I was able to find multiple
tools that help in this migration, but they normally target either a single
technique of migration or a single language.

By doing this search, we can also backtrack from the references used and check
if the tools here were based on other work, but only a part of it and therefore
just implemented a specific approach.
