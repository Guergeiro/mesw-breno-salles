# [From Monolithic Architecture to Microservices Architecture](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSREW.2019.00050)

## Abstract

The purpose of this work is the definition of a strategy, still in early stage,
that will be able to support the migration from a Monolithic Architecture to a
Microservices Architecture. This strategy aims to be applied to monolith
systems, encouraging their evolution into microservices-based systems. Using
this migration strategy, the newborn system will take advantages of a number of
benefits offered by microservices architecture, such as scalability and
maintainability. Companies will be able to migrate their old monolith systems
into more flexible microservices-based systems, evolving their software in a
more powerful one.
