# [Migrating Monoliths to Microservices based on the Analysis of Database Access Requests](https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE55356.2022.00008)

## Abstract

Many organizations seek to improve the maintainability and scalability of their
computing systems by migrating from a conventional monolithic architecture to a
microservice architecture (MSA). Note that service identification is the most
crucial step in architecture migration. In the current study, we developed a
microservice identification scheme based on analyzing database access to account
for the importance of the pattern "Database Per Service" in microservices
design. The proposed MIADA (Microservices Identification using Analysis for
Database Access) system facilitates the clustering of service endpoints used in
the identification and creation of microservices. The feasibility and efficacy
of the proposed MIADA approach were evaluated using two existing
service-oriented software projects, PlanApproval and CoCoME. The evaluation
results show that the MIADA approach can effectively recommend appropriate
clusters of service endpoints to construct microservices.
