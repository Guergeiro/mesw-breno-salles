# [Log2MS: a framework for automated refactoring monolith into microservices using execution logs](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS55610.2022.00065)

## Abstract

Service models and modelling are vital in monolith-to-microservice architecture
(MSA) migration of legacy systems. Prior work focuses on service identification,
whereas few efforts have been investigating microservice models and modelling.
It remains an immature field of Model-Driven Development (MDD) of MSA due to it
lack modelling methods and tools for monolith-to-MSA migration. We present
Log2MS, an MDD framework for automated transforming legacy monolithic
architecture into MSA using execution logs only. We define microservice and
microservice sequence diagrams to support monolith-to-MSA structural and
behavioural modelling; we present a source-code free monolith-to-MSA approach
and a prototypical tool which support automatically microservices identification
and MSA models generation; we developed a graphical editor to represent the
generated MSA models for further interactively modelling. Log2MS is evaluated
being of applicability, robustness, and effectiveness by comparative experiments
with 2 representative approaches and applying to 4 projects.
