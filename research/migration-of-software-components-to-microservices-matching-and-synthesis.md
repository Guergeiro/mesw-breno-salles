# [Migration of software components to microservices: Matching and synthesis](https://doi.org/10.5220/0007732101340146)

## Abstract

Nowadays more and more software companies, as well as individual software
developers, adopt the microservice architecture for their software solutions.
Although many software systems are being designed and developed from scratch, a
significant number of existing monolithic solutions tend to be transformed to
this new architectural style. What is less common, though, is how to migrate
component-based software systems to systems composed of microservices and enjoy
the benefits of ease of changes, rapid deployment and versatile architecture.
This paper proposes a novel and integrated process for the decomposition of
existing software components with the aim being to fully or partially replace
their functional parts with by a number of suitable and available microservices.
The proposed process is built on semi-formal profiling and utilizes ontologies
to match between properties of the decomposed functions of the component and
those offered by microservices residing in a repository. Matching concludes with
recommended solutions yielded by multi-objective optimization which considers
also possible dependencies between the functional parts.
