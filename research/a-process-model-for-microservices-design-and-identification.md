# [A Process Model for Microservices Design and Identification](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA-C52384.2021.00013)

## Abstract

Microservices have been established as an architectural style for developing
modern applications. A major challenge in theory and praxis is to identify a
adequate granularity of microservices. In order to achieve a consistent and
easily understandable process, this paper presents a process model for the
design and identification of microservices. This process model should support
the development of microservices and the selection of suitable identification
approaches. The process model is deductively derived on the basis of existing
identification approaches from literature. This serves to classify the
approaches into the phases of the presented process model but also to identify
research gaps and thus new approaches. The process model is evaluated first by
integrating existing identification approaches into the model. Second, a case
study shows that the process model allows for multiple perspectives on
microservice architecture and can lead to different architecture alternatives.
As a result, microservice architecture decisions can be better justified,
compared and derived by software architects in a standardized way. We also show
that the process model can be integrated into existing software development
processes.
