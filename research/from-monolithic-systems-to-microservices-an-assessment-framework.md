# [From monolithic systems to Microservices: An assessment framework](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106600)

## Abstract

Context: Re-architecting monolithic systems with Microservices-based
architecture is a common trend. Various companies are migrating to Microservices
for different reasons. However, making such an important decision like
re-architecting an entire system must be based on real facts and not only on gut
feelings.

Objective: The goal of this work is to propose an evidence-based decision
support framework for companies that need to migrate to Microservices, based on
the analysis of a set of characteristics and metrics they should collect before
re-architecting their monolithic system.

Method: We conducted a survey done in the form of interviews with professionals
to derive the assessment framework based on Grounded Theory.

Results: We identified a set consisting of information and metrics that
companies can use to decide whether to migrate to Microservices or not. The
proposed assessment framework, based on the aforementioned metrics, could be
useful for companies if they need to migrate to Microservices and do not want to
run the risk of failing to consider some important information.
