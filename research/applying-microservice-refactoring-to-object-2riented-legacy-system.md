# [Applying Microservice Refactoring to Object-2riented Legacy System](https://doi.org/10.1109/DSA52907.2021.00070)

## Abstract

With the evolvement of application demand and technology stack, the monolithic
systems need to be modernized due to a series of weaknesses. Many organizations
are drawn to breaking them down into microservices architecture style. In the
context of adopting microservices, microservices extraction and architecture
refactoring are the prior and challenge work. According to domain driven design
principle in microservices, the software units that are related to a same domain
can be extracted from legacy system to realize a special microservices. In
software system, database structure implies domain division in large part. An
improved approach is proposed to extract microservices candidates from
object-oriented legacy system, which originates from database structure and
combines source code relationship in the meantime. Then software architecture
should be refactored to adopt the microservices. Finally, a prototype tool was
developed to realize system decomposition and microservices extraction. The
experiments show that the approach is efficient and the tool is helpful to
system modernization.
