# [Search-based many-criteria identification of microservices from legacy systems](https://doi.org/10.1145/3377929.3390030)

## Abstract

The expensive maintenance of legacy systems lead companies to migrate such
systems to a microservice architecture. This migration requires the
identification of microservice candidates, which requires analysis of many
criteria. Existing search-based approaches to solve this problem are only based
on the coupling and cohesion criteria. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a many-objective search-based approach for identifying microservice candidates.
Its five objectives correspond to criteria pointed as useful by experienced
developers. Our approach was evaluated in the context of a legacy system. The
results show that our approach is very similar on optimizing the traditional
criteria of coupling and cohesion, but much better when taking into account the
additional criteria.
