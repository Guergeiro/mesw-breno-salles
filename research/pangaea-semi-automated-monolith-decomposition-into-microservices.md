# [Pangaea: Semi-automated Monolith Decomposition into Microservices](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-91431-8_60)

## Abstract

As microservices become the reference architecture for many practitioners,
decomposing an application into microservices remain a challenge. This paper
tackles the problem with Pangaea, a semi-automatic tool to decompose a software
system into microservices. Pangaea (i) takes in input a high-level model of the
system; (ii) formulates decomposition as an optimization problem, and (iii)
outputs a proposed placement of functionalities and data onto microservices,
using a visual representation that helps reasoning on the overall architecture.
Pangaea evaluates design concerns, communication overheads, data management
requirements, opportunities and costs of data replication. Our evaluation on a
real-world application shows that Pangaea consistently delivers more efficient
solutions than simple heuristics and state-of-the-art approaches, and provides
useful insights to developers.
