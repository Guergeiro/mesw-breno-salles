# [Mon4Aware: A multi-objective and context-aware approach to decompose monolithic applications](https://doi.org/10.1145/3466933.3466949)

## Abstract

This article introduces Mon4Aware, a multi-objective and context-aware approach
to decompose monolithic applications. Mon4Aware stands out for: (1) using
optimization based on multiple objective to allow monolithic applications to be
modularized in different ways, making its decomposition process flexible; and
(2) to propose a context meta-model to allow the decomposed modules of the
monolithic application to be able to adapt under certain contextual situations.
Software developers can use Mon4Aware as a guide to modernization activities for
monolithic applications, making them less error-prone. The approach was
evaluated through a case study, in which the conceptual viability of Mon4Aware
was demonstrated, as well as promising initial results in generating
recommendations for the decomposition of monolithic applications
