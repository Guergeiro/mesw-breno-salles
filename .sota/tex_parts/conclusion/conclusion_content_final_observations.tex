Decomposing monolithic architectures into microservices primarily involves
labour-intensive and time-consuming manual work, coupled with the difficulty of
identifying functional units due to the complex analysis required across
multiple dimensions of the software architecture. However, the application
proposed in this study's experiment favourably impacted the participants.

As evidenced by the positive evaluations and high scores obtained in the SUS,
participants perceived the application as user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to
navigate.

Regarding the workload, the application did not yield significant effects on
the decomposition process of monolithic architectures, as the performance
results were mixed.
