To access relevant research and information, it is advisable to search several
databases that specialise in scientific literature. \Cref{tab:databases}
presents a list of several such databases, including the ACM Digital Library,
Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Wiley, Springer Link, Engineering Village, and
Google Scholar. These databases contain a wealth of knowledge and resources,
including journal articles, conference proceedings, technical reports, and
more, which can be useful for staying up to date on the latest developments.
