Having evaluated most of the literature in regard to tools that help with the
migration of monoliths to microservices, we need to select those that are most
relevant for the purpose of this thesis. Given our focus on tools and their
implementation, we will prioritise works that have already developed a tool and
made it available for a free inspection and use. Therefore, if a publication
does not provide a link to the tool or instructions for self-hosting or
deploying it, it is not worth further consideration. This will help us to focus
our efforts on publications that provide practical and useful information about
tools and their implementation.
