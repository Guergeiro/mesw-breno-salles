 In the world of software development, the concept of microservices is gaining
 popularity. This architectural style has received a lot of attention in both
 business and academia, and converting a monolithic application into a
 microservice-based application has become a regular practice. Companies with
 limited resources struggle with migrating their already existing monolithic
 applications to microservices and software architects and developers
 frequently face challenges as a result of a lack of complete awareness of
 alternative migration methodologies making the refactoring process even
 harder. The goal of this study is to structurally analyse the state of the
 art in regards to the migration of monolithic applications to microservices
 architectural style, mainly how tools are helping architects, engineers, and
 developers in this migration and how automated they are. To address this
 challenge, a systematic literature review was conducted, resulting in the
 identification of one hundred and six relevant publications. These
 publications were organised and grouped to provide a more comprehensive
 understanding of the current tools available for microservice migration.
 Finally, we present a high-level idea for an extensible tool that may aid
 architects, engineers, and developers during the refactoring process by
 addressing gaps in understanding of various migration tools and approaches,
 allowing for easy comparison between multiple options.
