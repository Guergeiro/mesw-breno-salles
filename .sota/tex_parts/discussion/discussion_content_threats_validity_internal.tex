A potential threat to the study is the absence of a control or test group.
Without a comparison group, it becomes challenging to establish a clear causal
relationship between the treatment (use of the application) and the outcome
(usability and workload evaluations). The lack of a control group limits our
ability to determine whether any observed changes or improvements in usability
and workload are specifically attributable to the use of the application or
could be influenced by other factors. We advise that this study ins performed
with a control group.
