One threat is the degree to which the study's measurements accurately capture
the intended constructs or concepts using the correct metrics to evaluate
results. In our case, we wanted to measure the usability and workload of the
application developed, and measures such as the System Usability Scale (SUS)
and Raw Task Load Index (Raw-TLX) were employed to assess them, as mentioned in
\Cref{sub:sus,sub:raw-tlx}.
