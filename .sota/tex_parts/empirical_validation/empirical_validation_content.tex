Empirical validation is used to validate a developed application. Thus, we
prepared an empirical study to confirm that it helps decompose monoliths. The
study design is presented in \Cref{sub:design}, outlining the methodology and
approach employed. Subsequently, \Cref{sub:execution} explains the execution of
the study, providing details on how the validation process was carried out.
Data analysis is the primary focus of \Cref{sub:analysis}, where the collected
data from the empirical study is analysed and evaluated.
\Cref{sub:interpretation} interprets the data analysis, offering conclusions,
interpretations, and implications from the study's findings.
