Empirical validation is used to validate a developed application. Thus, we
prepared an empirical study to confirm that it helps decompose monoliths.

In this section, we present an empirical study we designed and ran to evaluate
to which extent our tool actually aids in the migration of monoliths to
microservices. The study design is presented in \Cref{sub:design}, outlining
the methodology and approach employed. Subsequently, \Cref{sub:execution}
explains the execution of the study, providing details on how the validation
process was carried out. Data analysis is the primary focus of
\Cref{sub:analysis}, where the collected data from the empirical study is
analysed and evaluated.
