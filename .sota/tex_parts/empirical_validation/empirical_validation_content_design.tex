As mentioned in \Cref{sub:tool_design}, we developed an application to address
RQ2 stated in \Cref{sec:introduction}. It is important to note that the
validation of such a tool is not solely based on the quality of the
microservices decomposition itself, as this responsibility lies with the
underlying tools used for decomposition. Instead, the validation focuses on how
effectively and efficiently the application aids architects, engineers, and
developers in their migration processes.

The study conducted aims to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of users
utilising the application in performing decomposition tasks. Once participants
complete the task, they are requested to fill out a questionnaire based on the
System Usability Scale (SUS) \cite{brooke1996sus} and Raw Task Load Index
(Raw-TLX) \cite{hart2006nasa}.

The target audience for this study is software developers, engineers, and
architects at various levels of expertise. We created a questionnaire (Appendix
A) that serves as a structured tool for collecting data and participant
feedback, aiding in evaluating and analysing the application's usability and
task load.
