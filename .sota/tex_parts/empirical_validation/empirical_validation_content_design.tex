As mentioned in \Cref{sub:tool_design}, we developed an application to answer the RQ2 explained in \Cref{sec:introduction}. This type of tool can only be validated by how it helps architects, engineers and developers in their migration process, not by how good the microservices decomposition is, as this later validation should be the responsibility of the underlying tools.

With this study, we ought to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of users using our application when performing a decomposition task. After that task is completed, the users will fill in a questionaire based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) and NASA's Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).

The target audience of this study are the general population of software developers, engineers, architects from any level.

In order to perform this study we have made a questionaire which can be found in Appendix A.
