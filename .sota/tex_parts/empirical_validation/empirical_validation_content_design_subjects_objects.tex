Subjects are who the study is targeted for and objects are what the study will be. In the case of subjects, we have a broad target demographic, since not only we want already senior level developers, engineers and architects to evaluate the visability of using the application in their migrations, but also more junior level users to have an easier entrypoint for monolith decompositions, therefore our study aims to target that demographic population. In the end, the study was able to get some pull both ends of the spectrum.
As for objects, the subjects are required to complete a monolith decomposition task. The tasks are all the same, what differs is the monolith project each task is targetting. There are three projects in mind, one of them is used as tutorial, while the other two are reserved for the users themselves. The projects vary in the amount of classes for a heterogeneous study.
