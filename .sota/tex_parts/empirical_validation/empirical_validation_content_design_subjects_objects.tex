In the study, the subjects refer to the individuals who are the target
participants for evaluation. In contrast, the objects refer to the tasks or
activities the participants perform during the study.

For the subjects, the study aims to target a broad demographic of participants.
The population includes senior-level developers, engineers, and architects who
can assess the viability of the application in their migration processes and
more junior-level users looking into a more accessible entry point for monolith
decompositions. By including participants from both ends of the experience
spectrum, the study can gather insights and feedback from a diverse range of
users.

As for the objects, the subjects are required to complete a monolith
decomposition task. The specific tasks are consistent across all participants,
but the monolith projects targeted for decomposition differ. Three projects are
considered, one serving as a tutorial or instructional example, while the other
two are reserved for the participants to apply the application to their
respective tasks. The choice of projects varies regarding the number of classes
and complexity, providing a heterogeneous study environment.
