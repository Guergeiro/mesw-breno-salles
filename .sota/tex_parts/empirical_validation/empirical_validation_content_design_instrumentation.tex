Like it was mentioned in \Cref{sub:subjects_objects}, there are three projects will be used in order to perform this study. The tutorial uses a project designated YarkAdminMS \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Guergeiro/Yark-AdminMS}} with sixty nine classes. Task number one uses project a Warehouse System \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Guergeiro/Warehouse-system}} seventy nine classes, whereas task number two is based on a Petclinic System \footnote{\url{https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic}} with a total of forty classes. All projects are based on Java since the application, at the moment, only has Java as the underlying tool for decomposition.

Some projects were forked into this author Github account, so that they are permanently accessible.
