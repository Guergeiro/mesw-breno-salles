As mentioned in \Cref{sub:subjects_objects}, three specific projects have been
selected to be used in this study. The tutorial project, designated as
YarkAdminMS \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Guergeiro/Yark-AdminMS}},
consists of sixty-nine classes \cite{brito2021identification}. Task number one
utilises a Warehouse System
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Guergeiro/Warehouse-system}} project with a
total of seventy-nine classes \cite{brito2021identification}, while task number
two is based on a Petclinic System
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic}} project
with forty classes. All of these projects are implemented in Java since,
currently, the application supports Java as the primary language for
decomposition. It is worth noting that the projects used in the study were
forked into the author's GitHub account to ensure permanent accessibility and
availability for the study.
