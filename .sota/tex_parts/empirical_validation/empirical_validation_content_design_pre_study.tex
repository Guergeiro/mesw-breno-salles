The purpose of an empirical study is for the study to reflect what the application is doing. To do that, we must be sure that the study and the tasks run as smoothly as possible, that is, that the users responses reflect exactly what the application is and not the problems our questionaire or task have. In order to deal with that, we employed a plan of running a mock study iteratively with live support, while taking notes of the difficulty the person felt during it. Afterwards, with tweaked the study to fix the problems felt during it and ran it again with a different person, so that this new person is not influenced by already knowing what to expect. People that were subject to this mock run are automatically discarded from the final study, for the same reasons.
