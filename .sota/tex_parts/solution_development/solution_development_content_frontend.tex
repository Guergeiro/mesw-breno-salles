The application frontend is developed using Astro as the foundational framework
while primarily utilising React and Solid as the underlying UI frameworks. The
frontend implementation encompasses three main pages: the tool selection page,
which also serves as the homepage, the results page, and the comparison page.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tool Selection Page/Homepage (\Cref{sub:frontend_tool_selection}) -
    serves as the initial interface where users can select the desired tool for
    the decomposition process. It provides a user-friendly environment for tool
    exploration and selection, enabling users to make informed decisions about
    the tools they wish to utilise.
  \item Results Page (\Cref{sub:frontend_results}) - displays the outcomes of
    the decomposition process. It presents the findings and relevant
    information, showcasing the success or failure of each decomposition job.
    Users can review and analyse the results, as well as select the
    decompositions for further comparison.
  \item Comparison Page (\Cref{sub:frontend_comparison}) - facilitates a
    side-by-side evaluation of different decomposition results or tool
    combinations. It allows users to compare and contrast the outcomes of
    various decompositions, aiding in the identification of patterns, trends,
    and performance differences among the different tools employed.
\end{enumerate}
