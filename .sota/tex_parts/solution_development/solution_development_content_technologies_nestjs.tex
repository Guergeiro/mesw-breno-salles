Kamil My≈õliwiec created NestJS to facilitate the development of efficient and scalable backend applications using Node.js. This framework supports JavaScript and TypeScript languages, allowing developers to choose the language that best suits their project requirements.
One of the distinguishing features of NestJS is its ability to use various programming paradigms, namely Functional Programming (FP), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). By incorporating elements from these paradigms, NestJS provides developers with a toolkit to build applications using a combination of functional and object-oriented concepts that allow them to leverage the strengths of each approach, fostering code modularity, maintainability, and reusability.
NestJS is an opinionated framework that draws inspiration from Angular and is similar to the Spring framework for Java in the Node.js ecosystem. Like Spring, NestJS offers comprehensive documentation outlining solutions to common backend challenges. It accomplishes this by providing adapters and integrations with popular existing solutions.
With the speed, ease of use and integrations it provides, NestJS is used for both the backend and the underlying tool implementation.
