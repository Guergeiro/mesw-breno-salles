As stated in \Cref{sub:technologies}, the entire backend of the system is
developed using the Node.js runtime, the TypeScript language, and the NestJS
framework. Following the specifications outlined in \Cref{sub:tool_design},
both the backend and the tool adapter components are monolithic applications.
These components communicate through a message broker, utilising Redis as the
underlying technology for message queuing and delivery. This messaging system
enables seamless interaction and data exchange between the backend and the tool
adapter, facilitating the flow of information within the system's
infrastructure.
