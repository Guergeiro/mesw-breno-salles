To provide a better user experience to the authentication and authorization mechanism explained in \Cref{sub:backend_auth}, we make use of local storage to store the user id. The flowchart that represents this logic exists in \Cref{fig:frontend_auth_state}.

The user can at any point manually remove its own user id, with the risk of losing access to all its previous decompositions.
