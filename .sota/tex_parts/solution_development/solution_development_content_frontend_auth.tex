In order to enhance the user experience of the authentication and authorisation
mechanism described in \Cref{sub:backend_auth}, the application utilises local
storage to store the user id. This approach provides a seamless and persistent
user experience by retaining the user's identification information across
sessions. The flowchart depicting the logic of this process is presented in
\Cref{fig:frontend_auth_state}.

However, it is important to note that users have the ability to manually remove
their own user id from local storage. This action carries the risk of losing
access to all their previous decompositions. Therefore, users should exercise
caution when manually deleting their user id, as it may result in the loss of
important data and restrict their access to previous work within the
application.
