One of the most difficult decisions of a frontend developer is choosing between
the UI framework; this is primarily due to the difficulty in switching once a
particular framework is adopted. Astro addresses this by adopting a
framework-agnostic approach \cite{astro}. It enables the creation of components
in popular frameworks such as React, Svelte, Vue, Solid, among others, which
translates into being unrestricted by the technological specifics of each
framework, thereby enabling the integration of components from various
ecosystems to speed up the development process.
