One of the first decisions that we have considered is which target platform the
tool should support. There are three major platforms that are relevant for this
purpose: macOS, Windows, and Linux. Determining which of these platforms to
focus on would require extensive surveying to ensure that the tool will be used
by the intended audience. While market share data suggests that Windows is the
most widely used desktop operating system, followed by macOS and Linux
\cite{desktop-usage-worldwide}, this may not necessarily reflect the operating
systems used by the architects, engineers, and developers who are responsible
for migration. Given the limited time frame, it is infeasible to conduct a
thorough survey to determine the preferred operating system of this target
audience. As a result, we have decided to adopt a more cross-platform solution.
After evaluating the options, we have determined that the browser is the most
suitable platform for this purpose.

One of the most difficult decisions of a frontend developer is choosing between
the UI framework; this is primarily due to the difficulty in switching once a
particular framework is adopted. Astro addresses this by adopting a
framework-agnostic approach \cite{astro}. It enables the creation of components
in popular frameworks such as React, Svelte, Vue, Solid, among others, which
translates into being unrestricted by the technological specifics of each
framework, thereby enabling the integration of components from various
ecosystems to speed up the development process.
