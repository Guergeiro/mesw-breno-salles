From the comprehensive enumeration of requirements delineated in \Cref{tab:functional-requirements,tab:non-functional-requirements}, it should be noted that their implementation still needs to be fully realised. This limitation in the embodiment of all stipulated requirements can primarily be attributed to the existing time constraints.

\begin{table}[!htb] \caption{Not Implemented Requirements} \label{tab:not-implemented-requirements}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[c]{p{16em}|p{8em}}
      \textbf{Requirement} &
      \textbf{Priority} \\
      \hline Web app allows for download of output. & {Could have *} \\
      \hline Web app allows for upload of previous outpus. & {Could have} \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
 \vspace{1ex}
 {\raggedright \textit{* It is possible to export the decomposition, but the exportation content would need to be revised to work with the upload requirement.} \par}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:not-implemented-requirements} contains requirements that primarily pertain to enhancing the quality of life for users, rather than directly impacting the core workflow of the application. These requirements were identified as non-essential to the fundamental operational processes of the application.
