Docker is a tool that can package software into containers that run reliably in
any environment \cite{docker-runtime}. One way to package an application is
with a Virtual Machine (VM), where the hardware is simulated and installed with
the required Operating System (OS) and dependencies. It enables the ability to
run multiple applications on the same infrastructure; however, because each VM
runs alongside its OS, they tend to be bulky and slow. A Docker container is
conceptually similar to a VM, but instead of virtualising hardware, containers
only virtualise the OS, which results in faster and more efficient applications
\cite{docker-container-vm}. \Cref{fig:docker_container_vm} demonstrates this
difference.
