The comparison page serves as the core component of the solution, providing
users with essential functionalities. On this page, users can:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Visualise microservices generated by each decomposition, enabling users
    to gain insights into the composition and structure of the system
    components (\Cref{sub:frontend_comparison_microservices_visualisation}).
  \item Toggle the visibility of decompositions allowing users to focus on the
    ones they want to compare
    (\Cref{sub:frontend_comparison_toggle_decompositions}).
  \item Focus on a microservice and check its constituent modules where users
    can delve into the details of each microservice and understand its internal
    components (\Cref{sub:frontend_comparison_microservice_focus}).
  \item Compare modules across different decompositions, which helps users
    identify similarities, differences, and variations in the composition of
    the system components (\Cref{sub:frontend_comparison_modules_comparison}).
\end{enumerate}

During the evaluation of various tools for visualising the comparison view,
four options were considered: Graphviz\footnote{\url{https://graphviz.org/}},
D3.js\footnote{\url{https://d3js.org/}},
Gephi\footnote{\url{https://gephi.org/}}, and
Chart.js\footnote{\url{https://chartjs.org/}}. Each tool was assessed based on
four categories: Customizability, Ease of use, Charts available, and Real-time
interactivity. A matrix analysis was conducted (as presented in
\Cref{tab:visualisation_tool_comparison}) to assess the strengths and
weaknesses of each tool.

    \begin{tabular}[c]{p{4em}|p{7em}|p{7em}|p{7em}|p{7em}}
      \textbf{Visuali\-sation Tool} &
      \textbf{Customizability} &
      \textbf{Ease of use} &
      \textbf{Charts available} &
      \textbf{Real-time interactivity} \\
      \hline Graphviz &
        Limited customisation options, suitable for creating static diagrams and graphs. &
        Easy-to-use syntax, accessible to non-experts. &
        Suitable for creating static diagrams and graphs, with limited support for charts. &
        Limited interactivity options. \\
      \hline D3.js &
        Highly customisable, suitable for creating custom and interactive visualisations. &
        Steep learning curve, requires a good understanding of JavaScript and web technologies. &
        Suitable for creating a wide range of charts, including bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, and more. &
        Provides advanced interactivity options, such as brushing and zooming, making it suitable for real-time visualisations. \\
      \hline Gephi &
        Customisable with a range of features, but may have limited design options. &
        User-friendly interface, easy to learn for beginners. &
        Suitable for creating network graphs and visualisations. &
        Allows users to interact with graphs and manipulate layouts in real-time. \\
      \hline Chart.js &
        Customisable with various options for color schemes, font styles, and animation effects. &
        Simple and easy-to-use API, minimal setup required. &
        Supports common chart types such as line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and more. &
        Provides basic interactivity features such as hover effects and tooltips. \\

Considering the industry's preference for node graphs in presenting
microservices \cite{cerny2022microservice} and after careful consideration of
the pros and cons, D3.js was determined to be the most powerful and suitable
visualisation tool for the specific use case.

In addition to having a powerful tool, the way information is presented and the
visual elements used are crucial. As suggested by Moody
\cite{moody2009physics}, using different shapes, colours, strokes, and line
dashes to depict entities and their relationships is an effective way of
expressing variation between entities in visualisations.

\begin{table}[!htb] \caption{Visual Expressiveness} \label{tab:visual_expressiveness}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[c]{p{8em}|p{8em}|p{8em}|p{8em}}
      \textbf{Entity} &
      \textbf{Shape} &
      \textbf{Size} &
      \textbf{Colour} \\
      \hline Service & Circle & Variable according amount of modules & Based selected decomposition * \\
      \hline Module & Square & Static & Mix between selected decompositions \\
      \hline Relationships & Line & Static & Static \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
 \vspace{1ex}

\end{table}

\Cref{tab:visual_expressiveness} illustrates how each visual representation
tool expresses different entities, highlighting the specific shapes and visual
cues employed to convey information effectively.
