The backend architecture follows the principles of the REST style and utilises
JSON as the format for data transportation. The implemented REST API adheres to
the guidelines of Level 2 in the Richardson Maturity Model
\cite{fowler-richardson-maturity-model}, which signifies a high level of API
maturity and conformity to REST principles.

\Cref{tab:rest_endpoints} provides a comprehensive depiction of the available
endpoints within the backend. These endpoints represent the various
functionalities and operations that can be performed through the API, allowing
clients to interact with the backend system and access its resources. By
conforming to Level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model, the backend ensures
standardised and efficient communication between clients and the server,
enhancing interoperability and scalability.
