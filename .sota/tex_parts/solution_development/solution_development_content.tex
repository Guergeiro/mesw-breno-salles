The system's backend is implemented using Node.js, an open-source JavaScript
runtime environment. Despite JavaScript's inherent limitations, such as its

crucial requirement in this work. To mitigate the drawbacks associated with
JavaScript, TypeScript was chosen as the primary programming language,
benefiting from its static typing and enhanced tooling capabilities.
