Each system component is deployed as a microservice (NFR01, NFR04, NFR07,
NFR08) in a Docker container (NFR02, NFR05) to facilitate scalability and
cross-platform deployment. This is especially important for the tool runtime
component, as we do not care how the specific tool is implemented as long as it
subscribes to decompositions requests and publishes the decomposition results
from and to the message broker.

The application incorporates a Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)
process. Whenever a new push is made to the \textit{master} branch of the Git
repository, it triggers a GitHub Action that initiates the build process and
deploys the applications. The hosting platform used for the application is
Railway\footnote{\url{https://railway.app/}}. However, since the application is
packaged with Docker, it can be hosted on any platform that supports Docker
images, as explained in \Cref{sub:docker}. This flexibility allows the
application to be deployed to various hosting environments based on specific
requirements and preferences. The tool is currently available at
\url{https://frontend-mesw.brenosalles.com/}, and there is a video tutorial of
the tool\footnote{\url{https://youtu.be/WQAAU9vQddA}}.
