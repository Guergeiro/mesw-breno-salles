The application incorporates a Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)
process. Whenever a new push is made to the \textit{master} branch of the Git
repository, it triggers a GitHub Action that initiates the build process and
deploys the applications. The hosting platform used for the application is
Railway. However, since the application is packaged with Docker, it can be
hosted on any platform that supports Docker images, as explained in
\Cref{sub:docker}. This flexibility allows the application to be deployed to
various hosting environments based on specific requirements and preferences.
