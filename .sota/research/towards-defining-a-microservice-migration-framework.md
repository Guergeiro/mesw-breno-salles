# [Towards defining a microservice migration framework](https://doi.org/10.1145/3234152.3234197)

## Abstract

Microservices are more and more popular. As a result, some companies started to
believe that microservices are the solution to all of their problems and rush to
adopt microservices without sufficient knowledge about the impacts. Most of the
time they expect to decrease their maintenance effort or to ease the deployment
process. However, re-architecting a system to microservices is not always
beneficial. In this work we propose a work-plan to identify a decision framework
that supports practitioners in the understanding of possible migration based
benefits and issues. This will lead to more reasoned decisions and mitigate the
risk of migration.
