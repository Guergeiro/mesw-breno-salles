# [From Monolithic Architecture Style to Microservice one Based on a Semi-Automatic Approach](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA47634.2020.00023)

## Abstract

Due to its tremendous advantages, microservice architectural style has become an
essential element for the development of applications deployed on the cloud and
for those adopting the DevOps practices. Nevertheless, while microservices can
be used to develop new applications, there are monolithic ones, that are not
well adapted neither to the cloud nor to DevOps. Migrating these applications
towards microservices appears as a solution to adapt them to both. In this
context, we propose an approach aiming to achieve this objective by focusing on
the step of microservices identification. The proposed identification, in this
paper, is based on an analysis of the relationships between source code
elements, their relationships with the persistent data manipulated in this code
and finally the knowledge, often partial, of the architect concerning the system
to migrate. A function that measures the quality of a microservice based on its
ability to provide consistent service and its interdependence with others
microservice in the resulting architecture was defined. Moreover, the architect
recommendations are used, when available, to guide the identification process.
The conducted experiment shows the relevance of the obtained microservices by
our approach.
