# [Architecting with microservices: A systematic mapping study](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2019.01.001)

## Abstract

Context A microservice architecture is composed of a set of small services, each
running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms. Many
aspects on architecting with microservices are still unexplored and existing
research is still far from being crispy clear.

Objective We aim at identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the
art on architecting with microservices from the following perspectives:
publication trends, focus of research, and potential for industrial adoption.

Method We apply the systematic mapping methodology. We rigorously selected 103
primary studies and we defined and applied a classification framework to them
for extracting key information for subsequent analysis. We synthesized the
obtained data and produced a clear overview of the state of the art.

Results This work contributes with (i) a classification framework for research
studies on architecting with microservices, (ii) a systematic map of current
research of the field, (iii) an evaluation of the potential for industrial
adoption of research results, and (iv) a discussion of emerging findings and
implications for future research.

Conclusion This study provides a solid, rigorous, and replicable picture of the
state of the art on architecting with microservices. Its results can benefit
both researchers and practitioners of the field.
