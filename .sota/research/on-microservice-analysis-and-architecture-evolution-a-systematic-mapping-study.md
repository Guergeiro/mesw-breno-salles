# [On Microservice Analysis and Architecture Evolution: A Systematic Mapping Study](https://doi.org/10.3390/app11177856)

## Abstract

Microservice architecture has become the leading design for cloud-native
systems. The highly decentralized approach to software development consists of
relatively independent services, which provides benefits such as faster
deployment cycles, better scalability, and good separation of concerns among
services. With this new architecture, one can naturally expect a broad range of
advancements and simplifications over legacy systems. However, microservice
system design remains challenging, as it is still difficult for engineers to
understand the system module boundaries. Thus, understanding and explaining the
microservice systems might not be as easy as initially thought. This study aims
to classify recently published approaches and techniques to analyze microservice
systems. It also looks at the evolutionary perspective of such systems and their
analysis. Furthermore, the identified approaches target various challenges and
goals, which this study analyzed. Thus, it provides the reader with a roadmap to
the discipline, tools, techniques, and open challenges for future work. It
provides a guide towards choices when aiming for analyzing cloud-native systems.
The results indicate five analytical approaches commonly used in the literature,
possibly in combination, towards problems classified into seven categories.
