# [An Approach to Evolving Legacy Enterprise System to Microservice-Based Architecture through Feature-Driven Evolution Rules](https://doi.org/10.7763/IJCTE.2018.V10.1219)

## Abstract

Evolving legacy enterprise systems into a lean system architecture has been on
the agendas of many enterprises. Recent advance in legacy system evaluation is
in favour of microservice technologies, which not only significantly reduce the
complexity in deployment of enterprise systems but also enhance the availability
of services to system users. However, there are technical challenges to overcome
towards a successful transformation. Challenges, relating to information
security, container optimisation, the performance of a new system and its
deployment, are particularly under concern. To cope with these technical
challenges, a new approach is proposed in this paper to govern the evolution of
legacy systems into a microservice-based and cloud-hosted architecture. This
approach includes a detailed working process, a set of transformation rules
towards microservices and their repositories. In addition, a conceptual
framework is drawn to provide a comprehensive illustration to this evolution
approach. Moreover, a case study is presented to demonstrate the application of
the proposed approach on the evaluation of a chosen legacy system, as well as
the procedure of system architecture optimisation.
