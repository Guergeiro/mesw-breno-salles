# [An automatic extraction approach: transition to microservices architecture from monolithic application](https://doi.org/10.1145/3234152.3234195)

## Abstract

Microservice architecture has been introduced as a new alternative to the
monolithic architecture. It has several benefits like scalability, reliability,
increase in agility and productivity, resilience to failure, ease of deployment
and maintenance, and decrease in time to market. Therefore, software companies
have showed a tendency to transform architecture of their legacy applications
from monoliths to microservice architecture. In this transformation process,
software development teams face the challenge of migration of large applications
to the new architecture, where understanding the current application and reusing
existing code base are important. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
transform existing applications into microservices using code repositories. We
use evolutionary and static code coupling information, and the graph clustering
methodology, in order to automatically extract microservices from monoliths. In
experimental analysis, we investigate two software projects and our approach
reach up to 89% of success rate by comparing extracted microservices with the
actual results.
