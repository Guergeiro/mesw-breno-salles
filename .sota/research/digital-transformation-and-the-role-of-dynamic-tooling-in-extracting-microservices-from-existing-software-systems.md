# [Digital Transformation and the Role of Dynamic Tooling in Extracting Microservices from Existing Software Systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85521-5_20)

## Abstract

The emergence of microservices architecture has promised to offer scalable,
maintainable, evolvable, agile, and failure-resilient software products
attracting software companies to migrate their legacy systems to a microservices
architecture. However, the migration process imposes a technical challenge to
effectively identify potential microservice candidates from medium and large
monolithic codebases. In recent years, automatic and semi-automatic migration
methods analysing the static and the dynamic behaviour of monoliths at runtime
are getting a growing attention. Along with the methods, dynamic data collection
tools are proposed. In this paper, we systematically review, compare, and
contrast dynamic data collection tools using criteria that were developed from
existing studies on monolithic to microservice migration. We identified eight
dynamic data collection tools and analysed the features using four open source
codebases from Github. The paper further presents an in-depth study of two
fitting tools applying them over the selected codebases. Such analysis enables
researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions in the selection of
dynamic data collection tools to automatically/semi-automatically migrate legacy
codebases.
