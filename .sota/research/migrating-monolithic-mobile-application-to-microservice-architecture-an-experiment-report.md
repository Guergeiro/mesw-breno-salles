# [Migrating Monolithic Mobile Application to Microservice Architecture: An Experiment Report](https://doi.org/10.1109/AIMS.2017.23)

## Abstract

The microservice architecture (MSA) is an emerging cloud software system, which
provides fine-grained, self-contained service components (microservices) used in
the construction of complex software systems. DevOps techniques are commonly
used to automate the process of development and operation through continuous
integration and continuous deployment. Monitoring software systems created by
DevOps, makes it possible for MSA to obtain the feedback necessary to improve
the system quickly and easily. Nonetheless, systematic, SDLC-driven methods
(SDLC: software development life cycle) are lacking to facilitate the migration
of software systems from a traditional monolithic architecture to MSA.
Therefore, this paper proposes a migration process based on SDLC, including all
of the methods and tools required during design, development, and
implementation. The mobile application, EasyLearn, was used as an illustrative
example to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed migration process. We
believe that this paper could provide valuable references for other development
teams seeking to facilitate the migration of existing applications to MSA.
