# [Extraction of Microservices from Monolithic Software Architectures](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2017.61)

## Abstract

Driven by developments such as mobile computing, cloud computing infrastructure,
DevOps and elastic computing, the microservice architectural style has emerged
as a new alternative to the monolithic style for designing large software
systems. Monolithic legacy applications in industry undergo a migration to
microservice-oriented architectures. A key challenge in this context is the
extraction of microservices from existing monolithic code bases. While informal
migration patterns and techniques exist, there is a lack of formal models and
automated support tools in that area. This paper tackles that challenge by
presenting a formal microservice extraction model to allow algorithmic
recommendation of microservice candidates in a refactoring and migration
scenario. The formal model is implemented in a web-based prototype. A
performance evaluation demonstrates that the presented approach provides
adequate performance. The recommendation quality is evaluated quantitatively by
custom microservice-specific metrics. The results show that the produced
microservice candidates lower the average development team size down to half of
the original size or lower. Furthermore, the size of recommended microservice
conforms with microservice sizing reported by empirical surveys and the
domain-specific redundancy among different microservices is kept at a low rate.
