# [Migrating from monolithic architecture to microservices: A Rapid Review](https://doi.org/10.1109/SCCC49216.2019.8966423)

## Abstract

Microservices architecture has become enormously popular because traditional
monolithic architectures no longer meet the needs of scalability and rapid
development cycle, and the success of some large companies in building and
deploying services is a strong motivation for others to consider making the
change. However, performing the migration process is not trivial. Most systems
acquire too many dependencies between their modules, and thus can't be sensibly
broken apart. It is for this reason that studies that provide information
associated with the migration process to practitioners are necessary. This study
gathers, organizes and analyzes 20 migration techniques proposed in the
literature. Results show that most proposals use approaches based on design
elements as input; 90% of the proposals were applied to object-oriented software
(Java being the predominant programming language); And that the main challenge
is to perform the database migration.
