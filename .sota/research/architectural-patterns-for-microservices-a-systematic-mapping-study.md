# [Architectural Patterns for Microservices: A Systematic Mapping Study](https://doi.org/10863/5599)

## Abstract

Microservices is an architectural style increasing in popularity. However, there
is still a lack of understanding how to adopt a microservice-based architectural
style. We aim at characterizing different microservice architectural style
patterns and the principles that guide their definition. We conducted a
systematic mapping study in order to identify reported usage of microservices
and based on these use cases extract common patterns and principles. We present
two key contributions. Firstly, we identified several agreed microservice
architecture patterns that seem widely adopted and reported in the case studies
identified. Secondly, we presented these as a catalogue in a common template
format including a summary of the advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned
for each pattern from the case studies. We can conclude that different
architecture patterns emerge for different migration, orchestration, storage and
deployment settings for a set of agreed principles.
